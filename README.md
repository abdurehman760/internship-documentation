## Conclusion
During my internship at Texagon, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that enhanced my skills in backend development, testing, CI/CD, documentation, and containerization. I learned about the importance of writing comprehensive tests, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and creating detailed documentation. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in working with APIs, Docker, and GitHub Actions. This internship has been a significant step in my professional development, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented team. 

Furthermore, I had the chance to work on AI-integrated applications like Coding Assistant and Travel Buddy. These projects allowed me to explore the integration of AI technologies into practical applications, enhancing user experiences and providing valuable insights. The experience of developing these AI-driven solutions has broadened my understanding of AI's potential and its application in real-world scenarios.
